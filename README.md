# pythonProject_CA2_SaraDidouh

The objective of this project is to create a login for the previous project made with django. In this way we add security and confidentiality to the project.

To this end, a login page has been created where end users can enter their credentials to access the web. Obviously, these users must be able to register themselves to facilitate the administrator's work, therefore, a page has also been created to register a new user through a form. To correctly complete the user access flow, a logout option has also been added; In this way they should not leave their account open and can exit and access again through another user if necessary.

Finally, and in order to deal with common problems of loss of access credentials, a last option has been created to reset the password through the email given when registering. In this way, if the user forgets its username or password, they can quickly restore them without any problem.

As part of this new project, it is also important to know that a home page and a base page have been added where the user will be redirected according to the options they make in the program.
